## Run in dev

### Open with Visual Studio Code Container (optional)

This solution allow you to run the project in a linux environnement. (**Docker Required**)

Run Visual Studio Code

Install "ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers" extension

Open Visual Code in Container : click green icon on bottom left screen, and choose "Open in Container"

Wait for container to setup, and that's it

### Start project

If open with VS Code Container : go to debugger (Play Icon with a bug) and choose "ðŸ¦Š Firefox" or "ðŸŒˆ Chrome"

Else :

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Build (manually)

Continuous deployment are setup and connected to this repository, but you can build the app manually.

```sh
npm run build
#Option: Test it locally
npm start
```

Copy all the file from `our` folder to the FTP.

## Project conception

### Why NextJS?

"Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed." - [NextJs.org](https://nextjs.org/)

NextJs allow us to build an application with React, and, in this case, generate a fully static application.

Additionally, the app is configured to function as a PWA (Progressive Web App). It has a resource caching policy and is also installable on the device.

For a simple project like this, NextJs is "overkill", and a site without a framework would be more optimal. But here, this choice results from a personal desire to demonstrate my skills in ReactJs.

### Project structure

Thanks to React it is easy to set up a system of reusable and configurable components.

Thus, the whole project is documented thanks to JSDoc, which makes it possible to enrich the JS elements, via a typing closer to TypeScript.

The design of components and CSS approach the SMACSS model (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS).

The project is structured as follows:
